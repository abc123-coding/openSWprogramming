This is the repository for the practice codes in 2023-2 OpenSWprogramming class.
But there are some errors that should be fixed so I plan to fix from March this year 2024.

The code is about image processing using OpenCV and Image Deeplearning.

If using the code based on OpenCV except deeplearning, you have to install OpenCV 2.4.13.6 version in advance in the website below.
